# DeepSPT
## Deep learning assisted Single Particle Tracking for automated correlation between diffusion and function
DeepSPT, a deep learning framework to interpret the diffusional 2D or 3D temporal behavior of objects in a rapid and efficient manner, agnostically. DeepSPT is a deep learning framework, encompassing three sequentially connected modules: A temporal behavior segmentation module; a diffusional fingerprinting module; and a task-specific downstream classifier module (Fig. 1a). The first two modules are universal, applicable directly to any trajectory dataset characterized by x, y, (z) and t coordinates across diverse biological systems. The final module capitalizes on experimental data to learn a task that is specific to the system under investigation.

### Usage
#### Installation
DeepSPT's installation guide utilize conda environment setup, therefore either miniconda or anaconda is required to follow the bellow installation guide.
 - Anaconda install guide: [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
 - Mini conda install guide: [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

DeepSPT is most easily setup in a new conda environment with dependecies and channels found in dependency.yml - Open Terminal / Commando prompt at wished location of DeepSPT and run the bash commands below, which creates the environemnt, downloades and installs packages, in less than 5 minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JKaestelHansen/DeepSPT
cd DeepSPT
conda env create -f environment_droplet.yml
conda activate DeepSPT
pip install probfit==1.2.0
pip install iminuit==2.11.0
```
DeepSPT modules and additional/helpful functions are contained in the `deepspt_src` folder.
DeepSPT modules are imported as:
```python
from DeepSPT import *

```
Three test python scripts are provided:
  - `simulate_diffusion.py` - Data generation of 2D or 3D diffusion of heterogeneous/homogeneous motion.
  - `usage_example.py` - test the clustering module on simulated data.
  - `usage_example2.py` - 

### For demostration
For demostration regarding presented data contained in the manuscript, please refer to the `_For_puplicaiton` folder where you will find the required information and scripts. To run on the same data download the data as outlined below.

### Data
  - DeepSPT accepts csv files or numpy arrays of shape (number of tracks, x,y,(z)).
  - Simulated data: simulate_diffusion.py, usage_example.py, and usage_example2.py contains functions to simulate trajectories.
  - To access data of the publication "Deep learning assisted Single Particle Tracking for automated correlation between diffusion and function" please download from: TBA
